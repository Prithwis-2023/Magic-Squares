# Magic Square Generator

The project marks the endeavor of creating a general algorithm for solving a specific family of singly even magic squares. Although the algorithm is yet to unravel its full potential, it has produced convincing results attributed to the generation of 6x6 magic squares, which are the first instance of the family of singly even magic squares. 



## Features

- Terminal Based Program written in Python.
- Organized display of resulting magic squares.
